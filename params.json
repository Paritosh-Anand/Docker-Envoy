Pushing required Docker events to Kafka will be useful to store/maintain state of services running in Docker ecosystem. Also we can consume events as messages from Kafka and execute desired custom tasks.\r\n![Docker Events]\r\n(https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_5E4E5D4E7819918F4A7FFC5AD14BA5406AEE511BEF98A38F756ED666B912BEA8_1469560303675_docker+events.PNG)\r\n\r\nJust started on this project, so there may be bugs right now. Will be adding review and test cases soon.\r\n",
